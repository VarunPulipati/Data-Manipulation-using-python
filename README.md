The data analysis process involved strategic segmentation to focus on critical metrics like position and Center of Mass from motion capture data, essential for understanding postural dynamics in AR. Visual analytical tools were used to interpret these metrics, revealing subtle behavioral patterns. Timestamp synchronization aligned motion capture with HoloLens eye-tracking data, delineating learning phases for precise analysis. Data filtering targeted moments of direct engagement, refining the dataset for clearer insights, which were then visually represented and prepared for detailed analysis and presentation.
